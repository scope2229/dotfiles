Devcontainer dotfiles

After a container is built this repo if installed will add in custom programs/scripts/gems/libs/etc that should improve productivity but not set a team back by forcing the use of certain tools globally.

# Environment

This repo is focused solely on containers and not physical machines although it could be adapted to be used  on a host machine.

It uses bash by default
Ruby is used for installation.

# Installation


# Components
 
** Bash **
Any custom bash scripts/aliases/functions/etc should be placed here

** VSCode **
Any VSCode configurations should be placed here for example: keybindings, settings, extensions and snippets.
